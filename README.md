# Smart Scientific Calculator Using Hand Gesture Recognition

## Overview
This project is a smart scientific calculator that works using hand gestures.
The user does not need to touch a keyboard or mouse.
By showing finger movements in front of a camera, calculations can be performed.
The system uses computer vision to recognize hand gestures in real time.

---

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a touch-free calculator system.
It reduces physical contact and provides a modern human-computer interaction method.

---

## How the System Works (Simple Explanation)
1. The webcam captures live video.
2. MediaPipe detects hand landmarks.
3. OpenCV processes finger movements.
4. Gestures are matched with calculator buttons.
5. The calculator performs calculations.
6. The output is shown on the screen.
